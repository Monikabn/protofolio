        "Hello Everyone !! As a recent Information science & engineering graduate, 
        I am enthusiastic about entering the world of technology and software
        development. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation 
        in programming language such as Core Java(J2SE), SQL,as well as problem-
        solving skills that I'm eager to apply in real-world scenarios.
         I am particularly excited about web development and have experience 
        creating responsive and user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS.
        I can portrait myself as good leader & have management skills.As I embark 
        on my career, I am open to opportunities that will allow me to further develop
        my skills, contribute to innovative projects, and work with a dynamic team of
        professionals. I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with 
        the latest trends in technology.
        If you are looking for a passionate and dedicated entry-level software 
        developer who is eager to make an impact, I would love to connect and explore
        potential collaborations. Let's build the future of technology together."</pre></center>
